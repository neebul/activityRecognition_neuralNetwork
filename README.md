# activityRecognition_neuralNetwork
Creation of a neural network to recognize physical behaviors with accelerometer data. 
In this project, features were generated using the raw data of a dual-accelerometer system. 

Data is organized as follows:
- a column identifying the subjects of the experimentation
- a column for the activity realized
- columns for the features
